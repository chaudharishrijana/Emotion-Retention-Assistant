![LangChain](https://img.shields.io/badge/LangChain-0.1.0-blue)

An AI-powered emotion analysis tool using LangChain for conversation management, detecting user emotions in real-time, predicting disengagement risk, and generating personalized interaction strategies.

##  Overview
This Streamlit application combines NLP models with LangChain's memory management to:
1. Detect emotions in user messages using Hugging Face Transformers
2. Manage conversation history with LangChain's memory buffers
3. Predict disengagement risk based on emotional patterns
4. Generate AI-powered interaction recommendations
5. Visualize emotional patterns and risk factors

##  Key Features
- **LangChain Memory Management**: Persistent conversation history with `ConversationBufferMemory`
- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: DistilRoBERTa model classifies text into 7 emotions
- **Disengagement Prediction**: Risk calculation based on negative emotions
- **AI Recommendations**: GPT-2 generates personalized engagement strategies
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Emotion distribution charts and risk indicators
- **Data Persistence**: Automatic saving/loading of chat history to JSON

Core Algorithms
python
# Emotion Detection
def detect_emotion(text):
    results = classifier(text)[0]
    return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)

# Churn Risk Calculation
def calculate_churn_percent(scores):
    risk_emotions = ['anger', 'disgust', 'fear', 'sadness']
    return sum(score['score'] for score in scores 
               if score['label'].lower() in risk_emotions) * 100

# Recommendation Engine
def recommend_action(emotion, user_message):
    prompt = f"Generate retention response for: {user_message} with emotion {emotion}"
    return generator(prompt, max_length=100)[0]['generated_text']
Data Persistence
