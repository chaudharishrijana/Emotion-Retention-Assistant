# Emotion Detection
def detect_emotion(text):
    results = classifier(text)[0]
    return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)

# Churn Risk Calculation
def calculate_churn_percent(scores):
    risk_emotions = ['anger', 'disgust', 'fear', 'sadness']
    return sum(score['score'] for score in scores 
               if score['label'].lower() in risk_emotions) * 100

# Recommendation Engine
def recommend_action(emotion, user_message):
    prompt = f"Generate retention response for: {user_message} with emotion {emotion}"
    return generator(prompt, max_length=100)[0]['generated_text']
